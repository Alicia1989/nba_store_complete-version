          <h1>History of the NBA Jerseys</h1>
          <p>
            Originally, people played basketball in any kind of athletic attire
            such as track suits and football uniforms. Players began wearing
            official uniforms in at the start of the 20th century. The attire
            featured knee-length padded pants, knee-length tights, and shorter
            pants.
          </p>
          <p>
            The basketball uniform has evolved over time. Over the years,
            fashions favored shorter pants. However, Michael Jordan helped
            popularize the long baggy shorts that players wear today. Also, the
            hip-hop culture promoted this move away from short and tight pants.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013, the NBA and Adidas, its apparel partner, tried to introduce
            sleeved jerseys that had NBA and large team logos on the fore.
            However, it was such a controversial move that even LeBron James
            ripped off the sleeves during a game in 2015.
